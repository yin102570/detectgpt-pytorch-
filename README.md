# detectgpt-pytorch-
This repository provides a refactored implementation of DetectGPT, a zero-shot method for detecting machine-generated text using probability curvature. It replicates the core experiments from the original paper, enabling users to distinguish human-written and AI-generated text through analysis of text perturbations and likelihood discrepancies.
